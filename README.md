Carbon-Cycle
============
This is the Matlab code for our SAGES final project.
It models the Carbon Cycle for 5 reservoirs plus emissions
At the end of the program, it graphs the carbon in each reservoir over the time period

Switch the comment on the declarations for the emissionRate and years variables to allow the user to choose a custom value for each variable.
